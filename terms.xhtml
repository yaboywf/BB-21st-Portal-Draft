                <p>Our website uses several storage methods, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cache Storage</li>
                    <li>Cookies</li>

                <h1>Cache Storage</h1>
                <p>What is cache storage?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cache storage is primarily used to reduce latency and improve load times</li>
                    <li>They do so by storing copies of files (like images, scripts, and web pages) locally, the browser can retrieve them quickly without needing to fetch them from the server every time you visits us.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>How we use cache storage</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We would automatically cache static pages (pages that do not interact with the server) onto your device.</li>
                    <li>This will enable shorter loading time, as well as enable you to continue access to our website even when without internet access.</li>
                    <li>However, all admin pages (identifiable by the URL containing '/admin') will not be cached to prevent unauthorised access.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Controlling Caching</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may want to disable caching or clear caching</li>
                    <li>To disable caching, please vist <a href="/settings" target="_blank">our settings page</a>.</li>
